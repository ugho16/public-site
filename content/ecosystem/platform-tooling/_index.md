# Platform tooling to build your Internal Developer Platform

An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is built by a platform team to build golden paths and enable developer self-service.

{{< hint info >}}
According to Gartner's latest _Software Engineering Leader’s Guide to Improving Developer Experience_, it is important to consider 3 key points:

1. “Improve developer experience by building internal developer platforms to reduce cognitive load, developer toil and repetitive manual work.”
2. “Platforms don’t enforce a specific toolset or approach – it is about making it easy for developers to build and deliver software while not abstracting away useful and differentiated capabilities of the underlying core services”
3. “Platform engineering teams treat platforms as a product (used by developers) and design the platform to be consumed in a self-service manner.”

In this platform tooling section we present a selection of platform tooling categories mostly used to build an IDP out of. "Platform as a Product" doesn't mean you should start from scratch with everything but build a compelling product to serve developers needs.
